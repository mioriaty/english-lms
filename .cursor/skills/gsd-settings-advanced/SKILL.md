<cursor_skill_adapter>
## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked when the user mentions `gsd-settings-advanced` or describes a task matching this skill.
- Treat all user text after the skill mention as `{{GSD_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{GSD_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. User Prompting
When the workflow needs user input, prompt the user conversationally:
- Present options as a numbered list in your response text
- Ask the user to reply with their choice
- For multi-select, ask for comma-separated numbers

## C. Tool Usage
Use these Cursor tools when executing GSD workflows:
- `Shell` for running commands (terminal operations)
- `StrReplace` for editing existing files
- `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Task`, `WebSearch`, `WebFetch`, `TodoWrite` as needed

## D. Subagent Spawning
When the workflow needs to spawn a subagent:
- Use `Task(subagent_type="generalPurpose", ...)`
- The `model` parameter maps to Cursor's model options (e.g., "fast")

<objective>
Interactive configuration of GSD power-user knobs that don't belong in the common-case `/gsd-settings` prompt.

Routes to the settings-advanced workflow which handles:
- Config existence ensuring (workstream-aware path resolution)
- Current settings reading and parsing
- Sectioned prompts: Planning Tuning, Execution Tuning, Discussion Tuning, Cross-AI Execution, Git Customization, Runtime / Output
- Config merging that preserves every unrelated key
- Confirmation table display

Use `/gsd-settings` for the common-case toggles (model profile, research/plan_check/verifier, branching strategy, context warnings). Use `/gsd-settings-advanced` once those are set and you want to tune the internals.

<process>
**Follow the settings-advanced workflow** from `@/Users/duongto/Internal/english-edu/.cursor/get-shit-done/workflows/settings-advanced.md`.

The workflow handles all logic including:
1. Config file creation with defaults if missing (via `gsd-sdk query config-ensure-section`)
2. Current config reading
3. Six sectioned conversational prompting batches with current values pre-selected
4. Numeric-input validation (non-numeric rejected, empty input keeps current)
5. Answer parsing and config merging (preserves unrelated keys)
6. File writing (atomic)
7. Confirmation table display
</process>
